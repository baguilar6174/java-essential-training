# Problem Description

A car dealership wants to create an application to manage the cars it has for sale. For this, it needs the following data (for each car): model, brand, and cost.

Currently, the dealership has the following price list:

| Brand      | Model   | Price  |
| :--------- | :------ | :----- |
| Volkswagen | Amarok  | 25000  |
| Volkswagen | Taos    | 32000  |
| Chevrolet  | Onix    | 22000  |
| Chevrolet  | Tracker | 30000  |
| Fiat       | Cronos  | 21000  |
| Fiat       | Pulse   | 24000  |
| Toyota     | Corolla | 28000  |
| Toyota     | Yaris   | 23000  |
| Renault    | Stepway | 20000  |
| Renault    | Duster  | 27000  |
| Nissan     | Versa   | 25000  |

Based on this data, ensure the program can:

* Sort the list of vehicles by price from lowest to highest and print the result to the screen.
* Sort simultaneously by both brand and price (both criteria) and print the result to the screen.
* Extract a list of all vehicles whose price does not exceed 23000.
* Filter only the vehicles of the Chevrolet and Volkswagen brands.
* Show all cars whose model contains at least one letter "a".
